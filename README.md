🌟 Enhancing Data Accessibility with LLM-Driven SQL Querying 🌟

Unlocking insights from CSV data using natural language queries sounded like a straightforward task, but it turned into a journey full of challenges and learning. Here’s how we tackled it and what we achieved!

🚀 Project Overview
We set out to develop a system that allows users to query CSV files using natural language, with SQL queries generated by a powerful Language Model (LLM). The goal? To make data retrieval as seamless as possible for everyone, regardless of their SQL knowledge.

🧠 Challenges We Faced
= Converting CSV Data to SQL:
 - Problem: Column names in CSV files often contain characters (like hyphens) that aren't SQL-friendly.

 - Solution: We created a preprocessing pipeline that sanitized column names, replacing problematic characters with underscores, ensuring SQL compatibility.

= SQL Query Compatibility Across Databases:
 - Problem: The LLM-generated queries weren’t always compatible with SQLite, which we were using for our database.

 - Solution: We modified the queries to replace TOP with LIMIT, switched functions like LEN to LENGTH, and handled string concatenation correctly for SQLite.

= Handling Variations in User Input:
 - Problem: Users might search for “alfa romeo,” but our database had “alfa-romero.” This led to failed queries.
 - Solution: We implemented fuzzy matching to map user inputs to the closest matching database entries, ensuring accurate results even with slight discrepancies.

= Preprocessing and Adjusting Queries:
 - Problem: The LLM-generated SQL queries needed fine-tuning to align with the actual data.
 - Solution: We created a preprocessing step that adjusts and corrects user inputs before executing the SQL query, enhancing the accuracy of the results.

🌟 The Outcome
The result is a robust system that seamlessly converts CSV data into a SQL database and allows for natural language queries. It intelligently adapts to variations in user input and is compatible across different SQL databases.

💡 Key Learnings
= Resilience and Adaptability: 
Every challenge was a stepping stone to creating a more resilient system.

= User-Centric Design: 
By implementing features like fuzzy matching, we made the system intuitive and accessible, even for those unfamiliar with SQL.

This project is a testament to the power of combining advanced AI with thoughtful engineering. We’re excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with data accessibility and LLMs!
